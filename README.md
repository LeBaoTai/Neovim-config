# My neovim config use ðŸ’¤ LazyVim
I've been using Neovim for a while, and have used most of the Neovim Distributions and found **LazyVim** pretty good, and easy to edit!

# Quick Start

## Requirements

* Neovim >= 0.9.0 (needs to be built with LuaJIT)
* Git >= 2.19.0 (for partial clones support)
* a Nerd Font(v3.0 or greater) (optional, but needed to display some icons)
* Lazygit (optional)
* **C** compiler `nvim-treesitter`
* for telescope.nvim

  * live grep: [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
  * find file: [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)

* A termial emulator

  * kitty
  * Alacrity


**Run** this command:

		git clone https://github.com/LeBaoTai/Neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
		
Just open Neovim everything will be **automatic**!!!
