# My neovim config use ðŸ’¤ LazyVim
I've been using Neovim for a while, and have used most of the Neovim Distributions and found **LazyVim** pretty good, and easy to edit!

# Quick Start
**Run** this command:

		git clone https://github.com/LeBaoTai/Neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
		
Just open Neovim everything will be **automatic**!!!
